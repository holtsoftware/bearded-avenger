# Summary

I carefully modeled the Warp Core Table Lamp from HD screen captures of the Warp Core on Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was designed to print in modular pieces without support. Print your Warp Core Table Lamp to be as tall as you'd like! This lamp adds a hypnotic sci-fi touch to any room. Geordi would love it.  

See a video of the Warp Core Table Lamp pulsing away on YouTube: http://youtu.be/78uyXZ--UQI  

There's plenty of room inside to get creative with how you light it, but no need for fancy electronics. I used these cheap blue icicle lights to get the desired pulsing effect, available on Amazon.com: http://amzn.to/2HfJ17Q

See "instructions" for printing and assembly tips.

Update 1/28/16
I've uploaded some support pieces to help prevent warp core breaches. When your warp core gets old and fragile from too much tinkering, these pieces can help keep it all together. There is no need to use them or print them if your prints come out good and your warp core is stable, but they're there if you need them. (They are aftermarket, and non-cannon.) I've also added some pieces to help support the interior lights along with a photo of how those work.  To get that cool white glow through the middle, try a string of these white LEDs: http://amzn.to/2CiERIw

# Instructions

Print Dilithium Plug, Lights, and MARC Lights (x2) with a translucent plastic. I used white with blue lights inside to be as screen accurate as possible.  

DO NOT FORCE LIGHTS INTO SUPPORTS! It will break the very delicate support beams. Instead, bend the ring part of the supports along the thin break in the ring to open the support beams like a flower opening its petals. You can then drop in the lights easily.  

Parts rest on top of each other to build the warp "stack". For added strength you might choose to glue them together, but it is nice to be able to take it all apart easily to adjust the lighting inside. Align the supports as pictured, noting where thick and thin supports go.  

Scaling: You may want to scale these parts for your printer. The base is the biggest piece with a diameter of nearly 14cm. Keep that in mind as you decide how to scale it.
